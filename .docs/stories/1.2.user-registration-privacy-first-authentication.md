# Story 1.2: User Registration & Privacy-First Authentication

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** privacy-conscious user,
**I want** to create an account with minimal personal information while maintaining security,
**so that** I can access DisCard services without compromising my privacy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User registration requires only email address and secure password with optional privacy-focused username
2. Email verification process implemented with temporary verification codes that expire within 24 hours
3. Password security enforced with minimum complexity requirements and secure hashing using industry standards
4. User session management implemented with secure JWT tokens and automatic expiration
5. Account recovery process available through email verification without storing security questions or personal details
6. Privacy policy and terms of service clearly presented during registration with explicit consent for minimal data collection
7. Optional two-factor authentication available using TOTP applications without requiring phone numbers

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **Supabase Configuration**: Database and auth infrastructure is already configured [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- **Express.js API**: TypeScript-based Express API framework is ready with proper security headers [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- **JWT Infrastructure**: JWT tokens mentioned in acceptance criteria and supported by existing setup [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- **Row Level Security**: Database policies already implemented for multi-tenant security [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- **TypeScript Shared Packages**: Type definitions available in packages/shared for API contracts [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]

### Data Models
**User Model Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User Model]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // UUID v4
  email: string; // Encrypted at rest
  emailVerified: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastActive: Date;
  privacySettings: {
    dataRetention: number; // Days
    analyticsOptOut: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Database Schema Details** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
- Users table uses encrypted email storage with hash for lookup
- Password hashing with secure bcrypt implementation
- Privacy settings stored as JSONB with default values
- Row Level Security enabled for data isolation
- Email verification tracking with boolean flag

### API Specifications
**Authentication Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]:

**POST /auth/login**:
- Request: `{ email: string, password: string }`
- Response: `{ accessToken: string, refreshToken: string, expiresIn: number }`
- Status Codes: 200 (success), 401 (auth failed), 429 (rate limit)

**Authentication Format** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#securitySchemes]:
- Bearer JWT tokens in Authorization header
- JWT format with secure signing and expiration

### File Locations
**Authentication Service Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Backend Services]:
- Controller: `/apps/api/src/services/auth/auth.controller.ts`
- Service Logic: `/apps/api/src/services/auth/auth.service.ts`
- Route Definitions: `/apps/api/src/services/auth/auth.routes.ts`
- Middleware: `/apps/api/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`

**Shared Types Location** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Shared Packages]:
- API Types: `/packages/shared/src/types/api.ts`
- User Types: `/packages/shared/src/types/user.ts`

### Testing Requirements
**Test Structure** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend Tests]:
- Unit Tests: `/apps/api/tests/unit/services/auth.service.test.ts`
- Integration Tests: `/apps/api/tests/integration/auth.integration.test.ts`
- Test Framework: Jest + Supertest for API testing
- Fixtures: `/apps/api/tests/fixtures/users.fixture.ts`

**Authentication Test Examples** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend API Test]:
- Test JWT token generation and validation
- Test password hashing and verification
- Test rate limiting and security controls
- Test authentication middleware behavior
- Test database isolation and privacy controls

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/mvp-focused-tech-stack.md]:
- Backend Framework: Express.js 4.18.2 with TypeScript 5.3.3
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with built-in auth capabilities
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with JWT token management
- Session Storage: Redis via Railway for session caching
- Testing: Jest 29.7.0 + Supertest for comprehensive testing

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]:
- Type Safety: All API contracts must use shared TypeScript interfaces from packages/shared
- Privacy by Default: All database queries must use row-level security contexts
- Secure Data Handling: Sensitive data (emails, passwords) must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- No Sensitive Logging: Never log sensitive information in plaintext

**External API Integration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Supabase Auth]:
- Supabase provides built-in authentication capabilities
- JWT token generation and validation through Supabase client
- Row Level Security policies for user data isolation
- Email verification through Supabase auth system

## Testing

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]:
- Unit Tests: `apps/api/tests/unit/services/auth.service.test.ts`
- Integration Tests: `apps/api/tests/integration/auth.integration.test.ts`
- Fixtures: `apps/api/tests/fixtures/users.fixture.ts`

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend API Test]:
- Use Jest + Supertest for API endpoint testing
- Include authentication flow testing with JWT validation
- Test security controls including rate limiting and account lockout
- Test privacy controls and data isolation
- Mock external Supabase auth calls for unit tests
- Use test fixtures for consistent user data

**Required Test Coverage**:
- User registration with email validation
- Email verification process and token expiration
- Login authentication with proper JWT generation
- Password hashing and verification security
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Authentication middleware functionality
- Privacy settings initialization and management
