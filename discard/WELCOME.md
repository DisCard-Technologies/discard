# Welcome to DisCard! 🚀

Hey Alex!

I'm excited to have you on board. I'm a Shitty developer myself, but I've set up the initial project structure and documentation with some help.

## What I've Done:
- Created the project structure
- Added initial backend routes for card funding
- Set up basic documentation
- Created the GitHub repository

## What We Need:
- Get the development environment running
- Connect the wallet integration
- Implement the card issuing service
- Build out the smart contracts

## How I Work:
- I'm not technical, so I'll need your expertise on implementation
- I can help with product decisions, user experience, and business logic
- I'll be using Linear for project management
- Please be patient with my GitHub skills - I'm learning!

## Getting Started:
1. Check out the README.md for the technical overview
2. Look at CONTRIBUTING.md for the development workflow
3. The backend/src/routes/funding.js file has the initial API structure
4. Feel free to modify anything - you're the technical expert!

## Communication:
- Let's use [Slack/Discord/Email] for daily communication
- I'll create Linear tickets for features
- Feel free to ask me about any business logic or product decisions

Looking forward to building this together!
