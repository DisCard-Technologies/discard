# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
DisCard's interface embodies the principle of "privacy through simplicity" - making powerful privacy protection accessible through intuitive design. The experience emphasizes user control and transparency, showing users exactly what information is collected (minimal) and what privacy protections are active. Visual design uses clean, modern aesthetics that build trust while avoiding the intimidating complexity often associated with privacy tools.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
**Card-Centric Design:** All interactions revolve around individual disposable cards as the primary objects, with clear visual distinction between active, used, and deleted cards through color coding and iconography.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features like merchant restrictions and spending limits are accessible but not prominent, allowing power users to access sophisticated controls while keeping the basic flow simple.

**Privacy-First Feedback:** All interface elements reinforce privacy protection, with clear indicators showing when cards are isolated, when data is deleted, and when transactions cannot be correlated.

**Trust Through Transparency:** Interface clearly communicates what data is collected, how long it's stored, and when it's permanently deleted, building user confidence in privacy protections.

### Core Screens and Views
**Dashboard/Card Overview:** Central hub showing active disposable cards with quick actions for funding, spending limits, and deletion. Visual emphasis on card isolation and privacy status.

**Card Creation Flow:** Streamlined process for creating new disposable cards with options for funding source, spending limits, expiration, and optional merchant restrictions.

**Crypto Funding Interface:** Real-time cryptocurrency conversion rates with wallet integration, showing exact amounts and fees before confirmation.

**Transaction History:** Privacy-preserving transaction view showing individual card activity without cross-card correlation or comprehensive spending analysis.

**Settings and Privacy Controls:** Comprehensive privacy dashboard showing data retention policies, deletion confirmations, and privacy protection status.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards including proper color contrast (4.5:1 minimum), keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and text scaling up to 200%. Privacy features must be equally accessible to users with disabilities.

### Branding
Visual identity emphasizes security, privacy, and user control through clean geometric design, privacy-focused color palette (deep blues, secure greens, with high-contrast accessibility), and iconography that reinforces the disposable/ephemeral nature of cards. Interface animations subtly reinforce the concept of cards appearing and disappearing while maintaining professional fintech aesthetics.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary mobile-first responsive design supporting iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and desktop browsers. Native mobile apps for iOS and Android to enable push notifications and enhanced wallet integrations, with feature parity across all platforms.
