# DisCard Security Guide

## Your Security & Privacy Protection

DisCard provides advanced security features that protect your financial information while respecting your privacy. This guide explains how our security systems work and how you can use them effectively.

## How DisCard Protects You

### Privacy-First Security

Unlike traditional credit cards that build comprehensive profiles across all your accounts, DisCard analyzes each card individually:

- **No Cross-Card Tracking**: Each card's security operates independently
- **Individual Behavioral Analysis**: Fraud detection learns your unique spending patterns per card
- **Zero Profiling**: We never build a comprehensive profile of your spending across multiple cards
- **Data Isolation**: Your card data is completely separate from other users and your other cards

### Real-Time Fraud Detection

Every transaction is analyzed in real-time (under 200 milliseconds) for:

- **Unusual Spending Amounts**: Transactions significantly larger than your normal spending
- **Transaction Velocity**: Too many transactions in a short time period
- **Geographic Anomalies**: Transactions far from your usual locations
- **Merchant Category Changes**: Spending at unusual types of businesses
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Deviations from your established spending patterns

## Security Features

### 1. Automatic Card Freezing

**How It Works**: If our system detects high-risk fraudulent activity, your card may be automatically frozen to prevent further unauthorized use.

**What Happens**:
- Card is immediately suspended (transactions blocked within 1 second)
- You receive instant notification via push notification
- You can review the suspicious activity and decide next steps
- Card can be unfrozen instantly if it was a false alarm

**Thresholds**:
- **Critical Risk (76-100)**: Automatic freeze
- **High Risk (51-75)**: Alert with freeze recommendation
- **Medium Risk (26-50)**: Security notification
- **Low Risk (0-25)**: No action required

### 2. Manual Card Controls

You have complete control over your card security:

**Freeze/Unfreeze**: 
- Instantly freeze your card if it's lost or stolen
- Unfreeze when ready to use again
- No waiting for new cards or calling customer service

**Security Settings**:
- Adjust risk tolerance (low, medium, high)
- Choose notification preferences
- Enable/disable specific fraud detection rules

### 3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enhanced security for high-risk transactions and account changes:

**When MFA is Required**:
- Large transactions (amount varies by your spending patterns)
- Transactions in new geographic locations  
- Account setting changes
- Card freeze/unfreeze operations
- Risk-based triggers

**MFA Options**:
- **Authenticator Apps**: Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password
- **Biometric**: Fingerprint or Face ID (mobile app)
- **Backup Codes**: One-time use codes for emergencies

**Setup Process**:
1. Go to Security Dashboard → Multi-Factor Authentication
2. Scan QR code with your authenticator app
3. Enter verification code to confirm setup
4. Save your backup codes in a secure location

### 4. Security Notifications

Stay informed about your card's security:

**Notification Types**:
- **Fraud Alerts**: Suspicious activity detected
- **Card Status Changes**: Freeze/unfreeze confirmations
- **Security Events**: Login attempts, setting changes
- **System Updates**: New security features or important updates

**Notification Channels**:
- Push notifications (recommended)
- In-app alerts
- Email summaries

**Customization Options**:
- Set quiet hours (no notifications during sleep)
- Choose severity levels for notifications
- Disable notifications for specific event types

## Understanding Fraud Alerts

### Alert Severity Levels

**Critical (Red)**:
- Very high confidence of fraud
- Card likely already frozen
- Immediate action required

**High (Orange)**:
- Strong indicators of suspicious activity
- Review and take action quickly
- Consider freezing card

**Medium (Yellow)**:
- Unusual but possibly legitimate activity
- Monitor closely
- No immediate action required

**Low (Blue)**:
- Minor deviation from normal patterns
- Informational only
- Very likely legitimate

### Responding to Fraud Alerts

When you receive a fraud alert:

1. **Review Transaction Details**: Check amount, merchant, location, time
2. **Choose Your Response**:
   - **"This was me"**: Report false positive to improve detection
   - **"This wasn't me"**: Confirm fraud and freeze card
   - **"View Details"**: See more information about the suspicious activity

3. **Take Action if Needed**:
   - Freeze card immediately if you confirm fraud
   - Contact support for additional assistance
   - Monitor account for additional suspicious activity

### False Positives

Sometimes legitimate transactions trigger alerts. This is normal and helps keep your account secure.

**When to Report False Positives**:
- You made the transaction yourself
- The transaction is from a legitimate merchant you recognize
- The alert seems overly cautious for your spending patterns

**How It Helps**:
- Improves fraud detection accuracy for your specific spending patterns
- Reduces future false positives for similar transactions
- Maintains security while improving your experience
