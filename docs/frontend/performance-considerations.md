# Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial app load under 3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Interaction Response:** Card creation and management actions respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and transitions

### Design Strategies

Interface optimized for performance through efficient image formats (WebP), lazy loading for transaction history, and progressive enhancement for complex privacy features. Critical user paths prioritized for fastest loading with advanced features loaded asynchronously.
