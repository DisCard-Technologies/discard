## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 successfully implemented comprehensive crypto wallet integration with 82% test success rate. The crypto service foundation, database schema, and TypeScript interfaces are established, providing the base infrastructure for rate conversion functionality. WalletConnect, MetaMask, and Bitcoin services are operational with session management.

### Data Models
**Crypto Rate Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#cryptotransaction-model]:
```typescript
interface CryptoRate {
  rateId: string; // UUID v4
  symbol: string; // BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, XRP
  usdPrice: string; // Decimal string for precision
  change24h: number; // Percentage
  volume24h: string; // Decimal string
  source: 'chainlink' | 'coingecko' | '0x' | 'backup';
  timestamp: Date;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

**Conversion Quote Model**:
```typescript
interface ConversionQuote {
  quoteId: string; // UUID v4
  fromCrypto: string; // Source cryptocurrency
  toCrypto: string; // Target (usually USD equivalent)
  fromAmount: string; // Input amount
  toAmount: string; // Expected output amount
  rate: string; // Conversion rate at quote time
  slippageLimit: number; // Maximum acceptable slippage
  networkFee: number; // Cents
  conversionFee: number; // Cents
  platformFee: number; // Cents
  totalFee: number; // Cents
  expiresAt: Date; // Quote expiration
  status: 'active' | 'expired' | 'used';
}
```

### API Specifications
**Enhanced Crypto Rate Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#crypto-endpoints]:
- `GET /crypto/rates` - Real-time rates with multi-source data and failover
- `GET /crypto/rates/conversion-calculator` - Calculate exact amounts for funding
- `GET /crypto/rates/comparison` - Compare rates across multiple cryptocurrencies
- `GET /crypto/rates/historical` - Historical price data for trend analysis

- `GET /crypto/quotes/{quoteId}` - Retrieve active quote details
- `DELETE /crypto/quotes/{quoteId}` - Cancel active quote

### Component Specifications
**Real-Time Rate Service** [Source: architecture/components.md#cryptocurrency-integration-service]:
- Multi-exchange rate aggregation with Chainlink, CoinGecko, and 0x API integration
- WebSocket-based real-time rate streaming with automatic failover
- Slippage protection through time-limited conversion quotes
- Comprehensive fee calculation including network, conversion, and platform fees

### File Locations
**Backend Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#backend-structure]:
- `/apps/api/src/services/crypto/rates.service.ts` - Enhanced rates service with multi-exchange support
- `/apps/api/src/services/crypto/conversion.service.ts` - New conversion calculator service
- `/apps/api/src/services/crypto/websocket.service.ts` - WebSocket service for real-time updates
- `/apps/api/src/middleware/rate-limiting.middleware.ts` - Rate limiting for conversion endpoints

**Frontend Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#frontend-structure]:
- Mobile: `/apps/mobile/src/components/crypto/ConversionCalculator.tsx` - Funding amount calculator
- Mobile: `/apps/mobile/src/components/crypto/RateComparisonView.tsx` - Multi-crypto rate comparison
- Mobile: `/apps/mobile/src/components/crypto/FeeBreakdownDisplay.tsx` - Comprehensive fee display
- Mobile: `/apps/mobile/src/components/crypto/HistoricalChart.tsx` - Price trend visualization

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Backend unit tests in `/apps/api/src/__tests__/unit/services/crypto/` for rates and conversion services
- Integration tests in `/apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/crypto-rates.integration.test.ts`
- Frontend component tests in `/apps/mobile/__tests__/components/crypto/` for all conversion components
- E2E tests for complete conversion workflows including real-time updates
- Testing Framework: Jest + Supertest for backend, Jest + React Testing Library for frontend

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/mvp-focused-tech-stack.md]:
- Chainlink Price Feeds for decentralized price oracle data
- 0x API for DEX aggregation and optimal swap rates
- CoinGecko API as backup price source with failover capability
- Redis for rate caching and performance optimization
- WebSocket for real-time rate streaming

**External API Integration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]:
- **Chainlink Price Feeds**: On-chain oracle contracts for tamper-resistant price data
- **0x API**: 100 requests per minute (free), aggregates 50+ DEXs for optimal rates
- **CoinGecko**: Rate limits vary, comprehensive crypto market data
- **Alchemy**: 300 compute units per second for blockchain price queries

**Rate Limiting Strategy**:
- Conversion calculator: 100 requests per minute per user
- Real-time rates: Unlimited through WebSocket subscription
- Historical data: 50 requests per minute per user
- External API failover with automatic source switching

### Security Requirements
**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Type Safety Everywhere: All rate calculations use Decimal.js for precision
- Secure Data Handling: Rate history limited to 7 days for privacy
- Privacy by Default: No user correlation in rate query logs
- Error Boundary Pattern: Graceful fallback for rate service failures

**Rate Data Protection**:
- No sensitive user data in rate queries
- Rate history automatically purged after 7 days
- Conversion quotes expire after 5 minutes for security
- No cross-user rate data correlation

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths align with the unified project structure. The enhanced rates service extends the existing crypto service pattern established in Story 2.1. New conversion components follow the mobile/web separation pattern with shared TypeScript types. Database migrations follow the established sequence - current sequence verified at 007_crypto_wallet_schema.sql, making 008_crypto_rates_schema.sql the correct next migration number. Story 2.1A (crypto testing improvements) does not introduce additional migrations that would conflict with this sequence.

## Change Log
