# Story 4.4: Compliance & Regulatory Features

**Status:** QA Complete  
**Priority:** High  
**Epic:** Privacy & Security Features (Epic 4)  
**Dependencies:** Story 4.3 (Advanced Security Monitoring & Fraud Prevention), Story 4.2 (Transaction Isolation & Privacy Protection)  
**Estimated Effort:** 16-20 hours  

## Story

**As a** compliant financial service,  
**I want** to meet all regulatory requirements while maintaining user privacy,  
**so that** DisCard can operate legally while preserving its privacy-first mission.

## Problem Statement

DisCard must comply with financial regulations including AML (Anti-Money Laundering), KYC (Know Your Customer), and data protection laws while maintaining its core privacy-first architecture. The challenge is implementing compliance monitoring and reporting systems that satisfy regulatory requirements without compromising the transaction isolation and privacy protections that differentiate DisCard from traditional payment solutions. The system must balance regulatory compliance with user privacy, ensuring legal operation while preserving user anonymity.

## Solution Overview

Implement a privacy-preserving compliance system that monitors for suspicious activities, manages minimal user data collection, generates regulatory reports with anonymized data, and maintains audit trails while preserving transaction isolation. The system will leverage privacy-preserving analytics, maintain separate compliance contexts, and ensure data retention policies align with both regulatory requirements and user privacy expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Anti-money laundering (AML) monitoring detects suspicious patterns while maintaining transaction isolation and user privacy protection
2. Know Your Customer (KYC) processes collect minimum required information and provide clear data retention policies and deletion schedules
3. Regulatory reporting generates required compliance data while anonymizing and aggregating information to protect individual user privacy
4. Transaction monitoring satisfies banking regulations while preventing creation of comprehensive user profiles or spending surveillance
5. Data protection compliance meets GDPR, CCPA, and applicable privacy regulations with user rights including data deletion and portability
6. Audit trail maintains compliance records with appropriate retention periods while ensuring actual transaction data privacy is preserved
7. Regulatory change management system adapts to evolving compliance requirements while maintaining core privacy protection principles

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Previous Stories

#### Transaction Isolation Infrastructure from Story 4.2
Story 4.2 established comprehensive transaction isolation that must be maintained for compliance:
```typescript
// Use existing isolation context for compliance monitoring
import { TransactionIsolationService } from '../privacy/transaction-isolation.service';

const isolationService = new TransactionIsolationService(supabase);
const isolationContext = await isolationService.getCardContext(cardId);
// All compliance monitoring must operate within this context

// Available methods from Story 4.2:
// - enforceTransactionIsolation(cardId: string): Promise<void>
// - verifyIsolationBoundaries(context: IsolationContext): Promise<boolean>
// - generateIsolationContext(cardId: string): Promise<IsolationContext>
```
[Source: Story 4.2 implementation - transaction-isolation.service.ts]

#### Privacy Analytics Pattern from Story 4.2
Use differential privacy patterns for compliance reporting:
```typescript
// From privacy-analytics.service.ts
import { PrivacyAnalyticsService } from '../privacy/privacy-analytics.service';

const privacyAnalyticsService = new PrivacyAnalyticsService(supabase);
const privateMetrics = await privacyAnalyticsService.generatePrivateAnalytics({
  metricType: 'compliance_rate',
  privacyBudget: 0.5,
  k_anonymity_threshold: 10
});

// Available privacy-preserving aggregation methods:
// - generatePrivateAnalytics(query: PrivateAnalyticsQuery): Promise<PrivateAnalyticsResult>
// - verifyKAnonymity(query: AnalyticsQuery, k: number): Promise<boolean>
// - generateLaplaceNoise(epsilon: number, sensitivity: number): number
```
[Source: Story 4.2 implementation - privacy-analytics.service.ts]

#### Security Infrastructure from Story 4.3
Story 4.3 provides fraud detection and security services that compliance can leverage:
```typescript
// Integration with existing fraud detection
import { FraudDetectionService } from '../security/fraud-detection.service';
import { IncidentResponseService } from '../security/incident-response.service';

// Available fraud detection capabilities:
// - analyzeTransaction(transaction: Transaction): Promise<FraudAnalysis>
// - Risk scoring and pattern analysis for compliance correlation
// - Incident response workflows for compliance escalation
```
[Source: Story 4.3 implementation - fraud-detection.service.ts]

### Architecture Context

#### Data Models for Compliance
Based on existing privacy-preserving architecture, extend with compliance-specific models:
```typescript
interface ComplianceEvent {
  eventId: string; // UUID v4
  cardContext: string; // Isolated card reference maintaining privacy
  eventType: 'aml_threshold' | 'kyc_required' | 'suspicious_pattern' | 'regulatory_report';
  riskScore: number; // 0-100
  detectedAt: Date;
  actionTaken: 'none' | 'alert' | 'report' | 'escalate';
  retentionUntil: Date; // Automated deletion schedule
  complianceData: string; // Encrypted compliance-specific data
}

interface KYCRecord {
  recordId: string; // UUID v4
  userContextHash: string; // Privacy-preserving user reference
  kycLevel: 'basic' | 'enhanced' | 'full';
  collectedData: string; // Encrypted minimal required data
  verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected';
  retentionUntil: Date; // GDPR/CCPA compliant deletion
  consentTimestamp: Date;
}
```
[Source: Architecture data models extended with compliance requirements]

#### Database Schema for Compliance
Extend existing RLS patterns for compliance data:
```sql
-- Compliance events table with privacy isolation
CREATE TABLE compliance_events (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    card_context_hash TEXT NOT NULL, -- From existing isolation pattern
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    risk_score INTEGER NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB, -- Encrypted compliance details
    action_taken TEXT NOT NULL,
    retention_until TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    detected_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- KYC records with minimal data collection
CREATE TABLE kyc_records (
    record_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_context_hash TEXT NOT NULL, -- Privacy-preserving user reference
    kyc_level TEXT NOT NULL,
    encrypted_data TEXT, -- Minimal required KYC data
    verification_status TEXT NOT NULL,
    consent_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    retention_until TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Apply RLS policies for compliance data isolation
CREATE POLICY compliance_isolation ON compliance_events
    FOR ALL
    USING (card_context_hash = current_setting('app.card_context', true));
```

#### API Specifications for Compliance
Compliance endpoints must maintain privacy while meeting regulatory requirements:
```typescript
// Compliance API endpoints
POST /api/v1/compliance/kyc - Submit minimal KYC information
GET /api/v1/compliance/privacy-controls - User privacy settings and controls
DELETE /api/v1/compliance/user-data - GDPR/CCPA data deletion request
GET /api/v1/compliance/data-export - Data portability request
POST /api/v1/compliance/consent - Update privacy consents

// Compliance officer endpoints (restricted access)
GET /api/v1/admin/compliance/reports - Generate regulatory reports
GET /api/v1/admin/compliance/suspicious-activities - Review flagged activities
POST /api/v1/admin/compliance/sar - Submit Suspicious Activity Report
```
