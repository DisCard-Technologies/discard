# Story 1.3: Core Card Creation & Management Interface

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to create disposable virtual cards with custom settings and manage them through an intuitive interface,
**so that** I can control my payment privacy and security preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Card creation interface allows users to generate new disposable virtual cards with user-defined names and purposes
2. Card customization options include spending limits (per transaction and total), expiration dates, and optional merchant category restrictions
3. Card management dashboard displays all active cards with clear visual status indicators and quick action buttons
4. Card details view shows card number, CVV, expiration date, and current funding status with secure copy-to-clipboard functionality
5. Card deletion functionality provides immediate and permanent card destruction with confirmation dialog and irreversibility warning
6. Card status tracking includes active, paused, expired, and deleted states with appropriate user interface feedback
7. Basic card usage analytics available showing total spent and transactions count without detailed transaction correlation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on completion of Stories 1.1 and 1.2:
- Development environment is fully configured with Turbo monorepo, TypeScript, and testing frameworks
- Authentication service is complete with JWT tokens, email verification, and TOTP 2FA support
- Database schema is initialized with users table and row-level security
- Foundation is ready for card service implementation

### Data Models
**Card Model Implementation** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Card Model]:
```typescript
interface Card {
  cardId: string; // UUID v4
  cardContext: string; // Cryptographic isolation key
  encryptedCardNumber: string; // AES-256 encrypted
  encryptedCVV: string; // AES-256 encrypted
  expirationDate: string; // MMYY
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'expired' | 'deleted';
  spendingLimit: number; // Cents
  currentBalance: number; // Cents
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;
  merchantRestrictions?: string[]; // Category codes
  deletionKey: string; // Cryptographic deletion verification
}
```

### API Specifications
**Card Management Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#Cards]:
- `POST /cards` - Create card with spendingLimit (100-500000 cents), optional expirationDate, merchantRestrictions
- `GET /cards` - List cards with status filter, limit parameter (max 50)
- `GET /cards/{cardId}` - Get card details with transaction history
- `DELETE /cards/{cardId}` - Permanent deletion with cryptographic verification returning deletion proof

**Request/Response Formats** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#CreateCardRequest]:
- CreateCardRequest requires spendingLimit (100-500000 cents)
- Response includes temporary exposure of cardNumber and CVV for initial display
- All monetary values in cents for precision

### Component Specifications
**Card Lifecycle Service** [Source: architecture/components.md#Card Lifecycle Service]:
- Technology Stack: Node.js with Fastify, PostgreSQL with row-level security, AWS KMS integration
- Dependencies: KMS for encryption keys, Visa API for card provisioning, Redis for session state
- Key Privacy Interface: `GET /cards/{id}/privacy-status` for real-time verification

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Backend services**: `/apps/api/src/services/cards/`
- **Mobile components**: `/apps/mobile/src/components/cards/`, `/apps/mobile/src/screens/cards/`
- **Web components**: `/apps/web/src/components/cards/`, `/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/cards/`
- **Shared types**: `/packages/shared/src/types/card.ts`
- **State management**: `/apps/mobile/src/stores/cards.ts`, `/apps/web/src/stores/cards.ts`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Backend**: Unit tests with Jest + Supertest at `/apps/api/tests/unit/services/`
- **Integration**: API tests at `/apps/api/tests/integration/cards.integration.test.ts`
- **Frontend**: Component tests with Jest + RTL for card components
- **E2E**: Detox tests for card creation/deletion flows
- **Privacy Testing**: Cryptographic deletion verification tests, isolation context testing

### Technical Constraints
**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]:
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP, 1000 per hour per authenticated user  
- Input validation: JSON schema validation with sanitization on all endpoints
- Token storage: Secure mobile keychain, httpOnly cookies on web
- Response time targets: <200ms for card operations

**Database Security** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
- Row-level security enabled on cards table
- Privacy isolation through card_context_hash
- No direct foreign key relationships for isolation
- Cryptographic deletion with verification through deletion_log table

**Privacy Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- All database queries must use row-level security contexts
- Card numbers and crypto addresses encrypted at rest and in transit, never logged
- Cryptographic deletion: card data tied to KMS keys for permanent destruction
- No any types allowed, all API contracts use shared TypeScript interfaces

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation aligns with established monorepo structure:
- Backend services follow existing pattern in `/apps/api/src/services/auth/`
- Frontend follows App Router pattern established in web app
- Shared types will extend existing `/packages/shared/src/types/index.ts`
- Testing follows established patterns from auth service tests

### Performance Considerations
**Frontend Performance** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]:
- Lazy loading for card screens and components
- React Query for API caching of card data
- Bundle size optimization with dynamic imports
- Progressive loading for card lists

**Backend Performance** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]:
- Database connection pooling for card operations
- Redis caching for session data and rate limiting
- Proper indexing on card_context_hash and status fields
- Query optimization for card listing with privacy isolation

## Testing

### Test File Locations
Based on testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

- **Mobile Screen**: `/apps/mobile/__tests__/screens/CardCreation.test.tsx`
- **E2E**: `/apps/mobile/__tests__/e2e/card-creation.e2e.ts`

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests must achieve >90% coverage for card service logic
- Integration tests must verify privacy isolation and cryptographic deletion
- Component tests must verify privacy indicators and secure copy functionality
- E2E tests must cover complete card lifecycle from creation to deletion
- All tests must use fixture data from `/apps/api/tests/fixtures/cards.fixture.ts`

### Privacy Testing Requirements
