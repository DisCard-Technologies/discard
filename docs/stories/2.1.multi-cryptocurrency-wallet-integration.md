# Story 2.1: Multi-Cryptocurrency Wallet Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** crypto user,
**I want** to connect my existing cryptocurrency wallets to DisCard,
**so that** I can fund my cards directly from my preferred wallet without transferring crypto to a new platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. MetaMask integration enables users to connect Ethereum wallets with secure authentication and transaction signing
2. WalletConnect protocol support allows connection to 100+ mobile wallets including Trust Wallet, Rainbow, and hardware wallets
3. Hardware wallet support implemented for Ledger and Trezor devices with secure transaction confirmation workflows
4. Bitcoin wallet integration supports major Bitcoin wallets through compatible APIs and QR code scanning
5. Multi-wallet management interface allows users to connect and manage multiple wallets simultaneously with clear labeling
6. Wallet connection security includes permission scoping, session management, and automatic disconnection for inactive sessions
7. Wallet balance display shows real-time cryptocurrency balances with USD equivalent values and refresh capabilities

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 successfully implemented a comprehensive funding system with Stripe integration, database schema with cryptographic isolation, and extensive test coverage (95+ test cases). The funding infrastructure provides a solid foundation for cryptocurrency wallet integration.

### Data Models
**Crypto Wallet Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#crypto-wallet-model]:
```typescript
interface CryptoWallet {
  walletId: string; // UUID v4
  walletType: 'metamask' | 'walletconnect' | 'hardware' | 'bitcoin';
  walletAddress: string; // Encrypted wallet address
  walletName?: string; // User-defined label
  connectionStatus: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'expired';
  permissions: string[]; // Scoped permissions
  sessionExpiry: Date;
  lastBalanceCheck: Date;
  supportedCurrencies: string[]; // BTC, ETH, USDT, etc.
}
```

**Crypto Transaction Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#cryptotransaction-model]:
```typescript
interface CryptoTransaction {
  transactionId: string; // UUID v4
  cryptoType: 'BTC' | 'ETH' | 'USDT' | 'USDC' | 'XRP';
  cryptoAmount: string; // Decimal string for precision
  usdAmount: number; // Cents
  conversionRate: string; // Decimal string
  networkFee: number; // Cents
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'failed' | 'expired';
  blockchainTxHash?: string; // External reference
  fundingContext: string; // Links to card without direct FK
}
```

### API Specifications
**Crypto Wallet Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#crypto-endpoints]:
- `POST /crypto/wallets/connect` - Connect new wallet with authentication
- `GET /crypto/wallets` - List connected wallets with status
- `DELETE /crypto/wallets/{walletId}` - Disconnect wallet with cleanup
- `GET /crypto/wallets/{walletId}/balance` - Real-time balance with USD conversion
- `GET /crypto/rates` - Current conversion rates for supported currencies

### Component Specifications
**Cryptocurrency Integration Service** [Source: architecture/components.md#cryptocurrency-integration-service]:
- Multi-blockchain integration with real-time conversion rates
- Wallet connectivity and transaction monitoring across BTC, ETH, and ERC-20 tokens
- Technology Stack: Node.js with Web3.js and BitcoinJS, Redis for rate caching, webhook handlers for blockchain events

### File Locations
**Backend Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#backend-structure]:
- `/apps/api/src/services/crypto/crypto.controller.ts` - Main crypto controller
- `/apps/api/src/services/crypto/blockchain.service.ts` - Blockchain integration
- `/apps/api/src/services/crypto/rates.service.ts` - Rate management service

**Frontend Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#frontend-structure]:
- Mobile: `/apps/mobile/src/components/crypto/` - Crypto UI components
- Mobile: `/apps/mobile/src/screens/funding/` - Funding screens
- Mobile: `/apps/mobile/src/stores/crypto.ts` - Crypto state management
- Web: `/apps/web/src/components/crypto/` - Web crypto components

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Frontend component tests in `/apps/mobile/__tests__/components/crypto/`
- Backend unit tests in `/apps/api/tests/unit/services/crypto/`
- Integration tests in `/apps/api/tests/integration/`
- E2E tests for wallet connection workflows
- Testing Framework: Jest + Supertest for backend, Jest + React Testing Library for frontend

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/mvp-focused-tech-stack.md]:
- WalletConnect v2.x for multi-wallet connectivity
- Alchemy for blockchain node provider and reliable blockchain access
- MetaMask SDK for direct browser integration
- TypeScript 5.3.3 for type safety across stack

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Privacy by Default: All wallet queries must use isolation contexts
- Secure Data Handling: Wallet addresses encrypted at rest, never logged in plaintext
- Type Safety Everywhere: All API contracts use shared TypeScript interfaces
- Cryptographic Deletion: Wallet data tied to KMS keys for verified deletion

**External API Integration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#walletconnect-integration]:
- WalletConnect v2 provides improved UX and supports 100+ wallets
- Requires careful session management and connection state handling
- Alchemy provides enhanced APIs beyond standard JSON-RPC with better error handling
- Rate limits: Alchemy 300 compute units per second, WalletConnect no specific limits (P2P)

**API Versioning Strategy** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]:
- All crypto endpoints use `/api/v1/crypto/` prefix for explicit versioning
- This follows established pattern from funding service endpoints
- Enables future API evolution without breaking existing integrations

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths align with the unified project structure. The crypto service follows the established pattern of other services (auth, cards, funding) with controller, service, and route separation. Frontend components follow the existing pattern with separate mobile and web implementations sharing common TypeScript types from the packages/shared directory.

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Frontend component tests in `/apps/mobile/__tests__/components/crypto/` and `/apps/web/__tests__/components/crypto/`
- Backend unit tests in `/apps/api/src/__tests__/unit/services/crypto/`
- Integration tests in `/apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/crypto.integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests in `/apps/mobile/__tests__/e2e/crypto-wallet-workflows.e2e.test.ts`
- Testing Framework: Jest + Supertest for backend, Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Test coverage requirements: 90%+ for crypto services due to financial data handling
- Mock external APIs (Alchemy, WalletConnect) in all tests with comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Security testing for wallet connection flows and session management
- Performance testing for balance update mechanisms and rate limiting behavior
