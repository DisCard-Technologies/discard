# Visual Recommendations for the Discard Product Page

This document outlines visual recommendations to enhance the UI/UX of the product page located at `./apps/web/pages/products/discard.tsx`. The suggestions are designed to align with the project's existing modern, minimalist, and bold design system.

### 1. Hero Section

**Objective:** Add depth and a premium feel without distracting from the primary headline typography.

*   **Image Type:** **Subtle Abstract Background Animation**
    *   **Description:** A slow-moving, generative art piece. This could be a subtle plexus of flowing lines, a soft grid pattern that fades in and out, or a gentle particle field. The animation should be low-contrast (e.g., dark gray lines on the light gray background) to avoid overpowering the text.
    *   **Inspiration:** Think of the subtle, sophisticated background animations seen on high-end tech or design agency websites.

*   **Placement:**
    *   **Location:** In the background of the entire hero section, sitting behind the main "PRIVACY. INSTANTLY." headline. It should act as a dynamic texture for the page canvas.

### 2. Features Section

**Objective:** Replace the basic SVG icons with richer, more engaging visuals that clearly communicate the value of each feature.

*   **Image Type:** **Conceptual Illustrations or Stylized 3D Renders**
    *   **Description:** High-quality, artistic assets that match the brand's clean aesthetic. Avoid generic stock photos. Each image should be a powerful visual metaphor for the feature it represents.

*   **Placement:**
    *   **Location:** Above each feature's title (`<h3>`). This replaces the current `<div>` containing the SVG icon with a larger, more impactful visual. As the user scrolls, a new image will anchor each feature block.

*   **Specific Ideas:**
    *   **For "Complete Privacy":** A stylized 3D render of a card that appears semi-transparent or is partially dissolving into abstract shapes, symbolizing anonymity and data protection.
    *   **For "Instant Conversion":** A clean 2D or 3D illustration showing cryptocurrency icons (e.g., BTC, ETH) flowing into a sleek funnel and emerging as a dollar sign ($), all rendered in the brand's color palette.
    *   **For "Global Acceptance":** A minimalist 3D globe made of clean lines, with glowing dots appearing on it to represent worldwide transaction points.
    *   **For "Bank-Level Security":** A 3D render of a modern, minimalist shield or a sleek vault door, matching the site's clean, high-tech aesthetic.

### 3. "About" Section

**Objective:** Connect the marketing promise directly to the tangible product right before the final, high-impact call-to-action.

*   **Image Type:** **High-Quality App Mockup**
    *   **Description:** A clean, professional mockup of the Discard mobile app. It should showcase the most visually appealing screen, such as the dashboard with several active virtual cards displayed. The phone frame itself should be minimal, matte, or "clay" style to keep the focus entirely on the app's UI.

*   **Placement:**
    *   **Location:** Centered, between the main headline ("Ready to reclaim your financial privacy?") and the descriptive paragraph. This placement ensures the user sees the beautiful, tangible solution right before being asked to download it, making the final CTA much more persuasive.
