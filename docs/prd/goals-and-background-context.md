# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable truly private cryptocurrency spending through disposable virtual cards that cannot be correlated across transactions
- Provide seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion supporting major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, XRP) with real-time market rates
- Deliver fraud and scam protection through card disposability, eliminating persistent payment method vulnerabilities
- Create platform-agnostic crypto spending solution supporting multiple wallets and avoiding ecosystem lock-in
- Establish market leadership in privacy-focused crypto payments within 18 months of launch
- Achieve 100,000 active users and $100M transaction volume within first year

### Background Context
The convergence of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption and growing privacy concerns in digital payments creates a unique market opportunity. Traditional payment methods create comprehensive spending profiles shared across institutions, while existing crypto cards require full KYC and maintain persistent identities that compromise user privacy. DisCard addresses this gap by implementing a disposable card architecture where each virtual card exists independently and can be permanently deleted, providing unprecedented privacy protection while maintaining compatibility with existing Visa merchant networks. This approach combines the privacy benefits of cryptocurrency with the ubiquity of traditional payment infrastructure.
