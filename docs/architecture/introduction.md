# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for DisCard, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack for the privacy-first disposable virtual crypto card platform.

This unified approach addresses the complex challenges of transaction isolation, multi-blockchain integration, payment processing, and cryptographic deletion while delivering a seamless user experience that makes privacy protection intuitive and empowering.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a greenfield project building DisCard from scratch. No existing templates or codebases will be used as the foundation, allowing for optimal privacy-by-design architecture without legacy constraints.
